This version of the SMAPI library is part of the HUSKY fidosoft project.


## OPEN WATCOM 2.0 FORK

This fork allows cross-compilation from Linux to Windows NT & OS/2 using Open Watcom 2.0:
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/zoomosis/smapi
$ cd smapi/make
```
Windows NT build:
```console
$ wmake -f makefile.watcom NT=1
```
OS/2 build:
```console
$ wmake -f makefile.watcom OS2=1
```
Where 'wmake' is Open Watcom 2.0's WMAKE.


## COPYRIGHT

Squish MSGAPI0 is copyright 1991 by Scott J. Dudley. The terms of use are
those of the GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (LGPL). In 2003 Scott has
agreed to change the terms of use to those of the LGPL. See LICENSE for

Contained in this archive is the source code for the Squish MSGAPI which
can be used to access Squish format message bases.  It is based heavily
on Scott Dudley's original MSGAPI0 code and was modified to support
compilation on platforms in addition to those supported by MSGAPI0.

Work on Scott Dudley's original MSGAPI0 code was performed mainly by Paul
Edwards and David Begley to produce the MSGAPI3x series of archives
(MSGAPI38 being the most well-known).  Craig Morrison also provided a bug
fix.  The objective of SMAPI was to rationalise MSGAPI38 and to avoid
future confusion in version numbering standards.

Use GNU version of make (gmake on many platforms) if don't specified other.

Note that the Linux and FreeBSD makefiles must be in UNIX text file
format (linefeeds only; no carriage returns), in addition to COMPILER.H
and MSGAPI.H.

The Linux Makefile creates a shared library and depends on GCC, while the
generic Unix Makefile (makefile.unx) should work on any Unix system with
any set of cc, ld and ranlib, and creates a static libarry.
